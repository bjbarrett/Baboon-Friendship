4 models
plotting code for DSI and rank for each model

Parenting effort lactation:

4 models
plotting code for DSI and rank for each model,
plotting code for the Bernoulli and gamma contribution for model 4,
attempt at extraction and plotting of the random slopes for model 4


"Consort" effort DSI:
Can males use their association with the female while she is fully swollen as an indicator of paternity?
